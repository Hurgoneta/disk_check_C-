I don't have much to do in my spare time, so I am starting to do simple projects in C++ till I can make something with it lol.

This one is a simple script which consolidates the disk C(if you have forced restart your computer and you have bad sectors or corrupted file system).
If you want to use the .EXE file, you need to open it with administrator privileged.

so enjoy :)
